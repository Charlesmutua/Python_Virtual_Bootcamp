OOP - prog paradigm based on the concept of objects wich contain data
        in the form of fields(attributs) and code procedures (Methods)

Object - A real world object representation. eg. Car, Dog, Driver
        SHARE - Data n Bhvr of the object.

        Data = Attributes - no. of wheels, seat capacity, engine type
        Behavior = Method Accelerate, stop, remaining fuel capacity

Class -  Blueprint from which objects are created.
        == A model for its objects=> A way to define attributes and bhvrs
		


Based on OOP paradigm, Simulate a school model 
factoring in the various attributes of a
 school and behaviors (Use data of your preference)
 
create a simple model to represent a book store ,
 in that one can borrow, 
purchase and finally return a book after being issued 

Simulate a simple employee model whereby the 
details of the employee are factored in first,  his/her salary is calculated 
and an operation salary increase taken in as a method(behavior)
